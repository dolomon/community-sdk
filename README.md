# OpenX4 E-Paper Community SDK

This is my hacky port of the amazing helper SDK.

---------------------------------------------------
*** THIS WILL NOT RUN ON THE XTEINK X4 HARDWARE ***

---------------------------------------------------

This is a version that I am playing with on the following hardware:

ESP32-C3 (4MB FLASH)
Rev 2.2 Waveshare 4.2" BW (4 GREY) ePaper display (inc carrier board).

This is very early stages, rewritten driver for SSD1683 controller and 400x300 panel.
